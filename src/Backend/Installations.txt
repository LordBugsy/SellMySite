If you want only want to make sure the backend is working properly, make sure you're in the directory where you set your "server.js" file and use 
"node server.js" to check for any errors. If there are, fix them asap, other than that, you're good!


The dependencies should all be installed after cloning the git repo, however if they aren't for some reason, install them with the following commands:
Needed for Backend:
- npm install dotenv
- npm install cors
- npm install express
- npm install mongoose
- npm install axios
- npm install bcrypt (it will be used to hash the password)
- npm install concurrently --save-dev (to run both frontend and backend at the same time with only 'npm start')
    add " "start": "concurrently \"npm run server\" \"npm run client\"" " at the bottom of the "scripts" value in package.json and make sure server and client are set up properly.

Needed for Frontend:
- npm install react-router-dom
- npm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux
- npm install -D sass-embedded
